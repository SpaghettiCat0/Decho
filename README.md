# Decho

##This isn't finished and most likely wont be for a while.

A custom implementation of the Echo VR APIs, written in Deno

## Running/Installation

Given this implementation uses Deno, you must install Deno. See [Deno Installation](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation) for specific steps on how to install it for your system. Deno is available on most operating systems and can run on a variety of machines.

Then, once Deno is properly installed and available on the command-line, you can start Decho using

```bash
deno run -A mod.ts
```
